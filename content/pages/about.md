Summary: About this

This blog is a place for my thoughs, creations, comments and *uncensored geekery*.

I'm [hacker](http://paulgraham.com/gba.html) currently located in [Brno, Czech Republic](https://www.google.cz/maps?q=Brno&amp;hl=cs&amp;sll=49.930008,15.369873&amp;sspn=4.108981,10.821533&amp;oq=Brn&amp;t=h&amp;brcurrent=5,0,0&amp;hnear=Brno&amp;z=11), making living as freelance Python developer. Some other things I enjoy include:

*   Clojure and FP in general
*   Coffee, beer
*   Cooking

I also like reading about all sorts of stuff: philosophy, politics, economics, lifestyle. Not only books, my favourite articles are published on [Tumblr](http://sputnikus.tumblr.com/) (which reflects Instapaper likes (along with some pictures)).

You can find my social links in sidebar or you can just mail me &#109;&#112;&#117;&#116;&#110;&#105;&#111;&#114;&#122;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;
