Summary: About me

I'm [hacker](http://paulgraham.com/gba.html) currently located in [Brno, Czech Republic](https://www.google.cz/maps?q=Brno&amp;hl=cs&amp;sll=49.930008,15.369873&amp;sspn=4.108981,10.821533&amp;oq=Brn&amp;t=h&amp;brcurrent=5,0,0&amp;hnear=Brno&amp;z=11), making living as freelance Python developer. I'm also interested in Clojure and FP in general.

## Work stuff

Started on small Python gigs (mostly data analysis, scraping). Currently most of the projects I'm working on are web apps, with a little bit of operations. I worked with Django and Flask connected to Postgres or MongoDB. You can find more about me and my work on [Careers 2.0](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/mputniorz). If you are interested in some collaboration, don't hesitate to [contact me]({filename}/pages/contact-me.md).

## Personal stuff 

I'm always for good coffee and/or beer. Cooking is my relaxation. I also like reading about all sorts of stuff: philosophy, politics, economics, lifestyle. Not only books, my favourite articles are published on [Tumblr](http://sputnikus.tumblr.com/) (which reflects Instapaper likes (along with some pictures)).

## Little disclaimer

Some links on this blog are affiliate or referral. They link to the stuff I use, read, eat or drink and think it's good enough for me. I'm trying to mark them with ```title```, so you can recognize such link by just holding your mouse pointer over it.
