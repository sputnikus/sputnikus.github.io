Summary: Create routines to get more stuff done

*Post is my answer for Danger & Play [question](http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/07/05/daily-routine/).*

Mike's post is not a first that I've read on this topic - the rest of the Internet talks about it too ([James](http://jamesclear.com/daily-routines-writers) [Clear](http://jamesclear.com/25000-mornings), [Buffer](http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-daily-routines-of-famous-entrepreneurs-and-how-to-design-your-own-master-routine)) and there's also a famous [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298160X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=081298160X&linkCode=as2&tag=bysputnikus-20&linkId=7BOIJTMO5YS3NFOW). As you can see, a lot of people just puts their work time to autopilot. But a lot of people will tell you, that doing this you are sacrificing your creativity. I don't think that's the case. Here's my daily schedule and some core principles.

## From waking up to lunch

Rise and shine around 6 a.m., drink lightly salted water and make myself a cup of [bulletproof]({filename}/coffee_and_beyond.md) coffee. At my standing desk, tune in some [podcast episode](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15576011/podcasts.opml)/[di.fm](http://www.di.fm/)/[music](https://play.google.com/music/listen) and work. I chop work time into 90 - 120 minute blocks with 2 breaks (around 30 minutes each), using them to hygiene and make some coffee or working out (exercise minimalist). After 3 of those chunks I'm usually done, which means 4.5 - 6 hours of focused time per day (of usually client work). Then it's time for earned breakfast (or shopping for it), 99% consists of eggs and some meat (bacon or fish).

## Rest of the day

Satisfied with my work and food, time has come to meditation (at least for 5 minutes), then go out (get some vitamin D or at least some fresh air). I often end up sitting in caf√© (like [Fusion](https://www.facebook.com/pages/COFFEE-FUSION/209200889117261), owned by Czech Barista champion of 2014), sipping on some premium gourmet shit. Return home for some dinner (or eat out if I want a good burger/india/etc.). After that I either go to grab drink or two with friends, read (books, blogs), work on some personal stuff or just play computer games. I finish my day by taking supplements, writing diary and cold shower.

## Core principles

Take a look at [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson_Law). First is universally applicable on all parts of life (but maybe not in popular 80/20 ratio), second is just about the power of strict deadlines. When at home, I often work while [standing](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html), which gives me that freedom to just leave (also great for your posture). When it comes to tooling, after years of testing bunch of apps, I'm now using [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/598820) for time counting and [Trello](https://trello.com/martinputniorz/recommend) for task tracking, sometimes combined with [Ovo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ilumbo.ovo) (when I need to kick my ass to produce work).

## Right mindset

To wrap this up, some thoughts. Don't panic, when your routines get screwed up, because it happens. Try to be [stoic]({filename}/stoic_zen.md) about it and get back on track. Good routine is a product of long run and continuous tinkering. Apply your principles on it, teach people about it and optimize. Because it's never ending process.
